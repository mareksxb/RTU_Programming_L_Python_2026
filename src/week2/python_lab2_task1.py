Lab 2.1 – Simple Datasets and Aggregates
----------------------------------------
Practice lists, dictionaries and tuples by computing simple aggregates.

Write these functions:
- average(values)               -> float
    Average of a list of numbers. Return 0.0 if the list is empty.
- largest_city(populations)     -> tuple (name, population)
    The city with the LARGEST population.
- smallest_city(populations)    -> tuple (name, population)
    The city with the SMALLEST population.
- total_population(populations) -> int
    Sum of all populations. Return 0 if the dict is empty.

`populations` is a dictionary like {"Riga": 605000, "Daugavpils": 78000}.
For largest_city() and smallest_city():
- If two cities tie, return the one that comes FIRST in the dictionary.
- If the dictionary is empty, return ("", 0).
- Built-ins such as sum(), len(), max() and min() are allowed.
  Hint: max(populations, key=populations.get) gives the key with the
  largest value.

In the main block: create your OWN datasets (a list `temperatures` with
7 daily temperatures, and a dict `city_population` with at least 5 cities),
call the functions, and print the results. Print the average with
1 decimal place.

Example run (with your own data the numbers will differ):
    Average temperature: 4.3
    Largest city: Riga - 605000
    Smallest city: Valmiera - 23000
    Total population: 806000

Examples (these are also used to check your work):
>>> average([1, 2, 3, 4])
2.5
>>> average([])
0.0
>>> cities = {"Riga": 605000, "Daugavpils": 78000, "Liepaja": 67000}
>>> largest_city(cities)
('Riga', 605000)
>>> smallest_city(cities)
('Liepaja', 67000)
>>> total_population(cities)
750000
>>> largest_city({})
('', 0)
>>> largest_city({"A": 10, "B": 10})
('A', 10)
